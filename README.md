DINet Viewer: Document Image Network Viewer
============================================================================

DINet Viewer is an interactive exploration platform to visualise document image networks. 
In particlar, we visualise here a subset of the Bentham word image collection (~95 images).

DINet Viewer has been developed during my PhD, entitled *Interactive, incremental and multi-level exploration of large collections of images*.
This PhD has been defended in November the 22nd, 2016 in the University François-Rabelais of Tours.

DINet Viewer can be tested online in my homepage: [http://frederic.rayar.free.fr/dinet/](http://frederic.rayar.free.fr/dinet/).

DINet Viewer has been developed with web technologies, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Third-party librairies are AngularJS, Linkurious.js, Math.js and Plotly.js
